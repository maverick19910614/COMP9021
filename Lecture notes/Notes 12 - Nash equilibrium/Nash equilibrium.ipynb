A way to express that Ruth and Charlie would be better off if they did not testify is to say that this pair of decisions is not _Pareto optimal_: there exists another pair of decisions (namely, both of them not testifying) associated with an outcome which is at least as good for both players, and better for at least one of them (in this case, better for both of them).\n",

    "The program `nash_equilibrium_calculator.py` creates a widget that expects the 4 pairs of payoffs, $(a_1,b_1)$, $(a_2,b_2)$, $(a_3,b_3)$ and $(a_4,b_4)$ to be entered in this form, all numbers being integers, with possibly spaces on either side of the parentheses and commas. To check input validity and extract the data, we take advantage of the syntax of regular expressions and make use of the `re` module and its `search()` function. This function tries and find a match between a pattern string and part of a data string, the pattern and the string being provided as first and second arguments, respectively. When the first argument can match many parts of the second argument, `search()` looks for the longest leftmost part. A character matches itself, while a dot matches any character:"
